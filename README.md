  <h3> A Protocol to Connect Them All: Seamless AI Agent Communication </h3>
</div>

Pebble breaks down the barriers between AI agent frameworks, enabling effortless collaboration across [Smolagent](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents), [AgnoAI](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewai/crewai) and more. One protocol to unite them all — simple, powerful, and ready to transform how your agents communicate.

## 🤔 The Problem

As AI agent ecosystems grow more complex, a critical challenge emerges: **agents built with different frameworks can't easily communicate with each other**. This communication barrier prevents:

- **Automatic Decision Making**: Agents can't collaborate on complex tasks requiring multiple specialized capabilities
- **Cross-Framework Collaboration**: Teams using different agent technologies are forced to build custom integration layers
- **Consistent Media Handling**: Image, audio, and video content gets processed inconsistently across frameworks
- **Cognitive State Sharing**: Agents can't share their understanding or context with other agents

Without a standardized protocol, creating multi-agent systems becomes exponentially more complex, requiring custom adapters for each pair of frameworks.

## 💡 The Solution

Pebble provides a universal communication layer that enables seamless interaction between agents built on different frameworks:

- **Framework-Agnostic Adapters**: Pebble's adapter system translates between different frameworks' internal representations
- **Cognitive Protocol**: Enhanced agent interactions with standardized cognitive capabilities (act, see, listen, think)
- **Smart Media Handling**: Automatic conversion between different frameworks' media requirements (URL → direct content)
- **Unified Message Format**: Standardized message structure ensures consistent data exchange
- **Persistent State Management**: Maintain context and cognitive state across interactions

With Pebble, your AI agents can focus on solving problems together rather than struggling to understand each other.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install Pebble
pip install pebble

# Or with uv for faster installation
uv pip install pebble
```
